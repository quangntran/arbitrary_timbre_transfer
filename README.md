# Arbitrary Timbre Transfer

This is a project in progress. 

## Introduction

The problem of arbitrary timbre transfer has not been explored. An architecture based on multi-domain learning for universal timbre transfer is proposed to tackle this problem, with the potential of setting a framework for universal style transfer trained on unpaired datasets of contents and targets in any domain, including visual style transfer and other audio style transfer tasks such as voice conversion. 

## Method

For the time being, please refer to this [Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10c-O5AximghJoOcRXjSo_QJpLiIfhZwbBfkrGnlR178/edit?usp=sharing) for a rough model description and methods.
